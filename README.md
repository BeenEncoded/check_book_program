#Checkbook Program  
  
---  
This program is designed to allow the user to keep track of their bank accounts and transactions.  Pretty simple.  
  
###Building the program:  
  
The program was developed on windows, and as such, the QMake project file will need to be modified slightly for other operating systems you intend to build on.  Build requirements are listed below:  
  
-  QMake
-  Compiler that supports C++14
-  Boost libraries
-  Qt libraries
-  Make or, on Windows, NMake
